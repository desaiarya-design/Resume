# Resume
A small Introduction
I have created a  Resume page with HTML and CSS . First I have created a <div> tag as a container for soreted coding and the i have given a <h1> tag for all the headings like name, aboute me , contact etc. and inside that information is given by <p> paragarph tag. For the bullet points I have given unordered list <ul> and then <li> for getting that bullets. then I have added a footer tag <footer> to give the copy right line and I have used &copy; to get that copyright symbol . Then a little tricky part was to create a table , a table<tag> was used then <tr> or creating table rows and then I have used <th> tag to give heading to the table rows and then to <td> for the rest of information in the table . Now the tricky part was it didnt have any border so i created a <style> tag and gave some styling to the table for table i have given border of 2 px solid double black. for th, td bordr in same and i have align all the items to the center.
So I enjoyed a lot creatingmy resume and fpund that table part a little bit tricky.
